# TODO:
- Create a simple website with news that was fetched (time limit?)
- Add more news sources (svd, aftonbladet, expressen, svt) and let the user choose by writing '!news dn" or something similar. Additional task, remember which user has what preference and let it present individual news depending on preference. Preference can be set with "!news dn" and if same user writes "!news" it will be automagically news from DN again.
	- SVD: www.svd.se/i/senaste
	- SVT: https://www.svt.se/ (a bit down there the links are for today, "senaste nytt")
	- Aftonbladet: https://live.aftonbladet.se/supernytt/news
	- Expressen: https://www.expressen.se/nyhetsdygnet/
	- More sources?
